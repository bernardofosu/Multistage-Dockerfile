ðŸ”Ž Breakdown

web:

Declares the process type.

Heroku (and similar PaaS) expects a web process for handling HTTP requests.

This is what gets exposed to the internet.

java

Runs the Java runtime.

$JAVA_OPTS

Placeholder for extra JVM options, injected by the platform at runtime.

Examples: -Xmx300m (memory limit), garbage collector flags, debugging options.

Keeps the Procfile flexibleâ€”no hardcoding JVM settings.

-jar target/dependency/webapp-runner.jar

Tells Java to run the Webapp Runner JAR.

webapp-runner is a lightweight Tomcat wrapper that lets you run .war files directly without installing a full Tomcat server.

--port $PORT

Instructs Webapp Runner to bind on the port given by the platform.

$PORT is an environment variable (Heroku assigns a random free port).

Without this, your app wouldnâ€™t receive traffic from the load balancer.

target/*.war

The actual application artifact (your packaged web app).

*.war expands to something like target/my-app.war built by Maven.

Webapp Runner will deploy this WAR on its embedded Tomcat.

DevOps Angle

This one line acts as your startup manifest.

As a DevOps engineer, you donâ€™t need to know the appâ€™s internal logicâ€”you just need to ensure the Procfile points to the right WAR file, JVM options, and port binding.

Itâ€™s equivalent to:

Docker â†’ CMD ["java", "-jar", "webapp-runner.jar", "--port", "8080", "my-app.war"]

Kubernetes â†’ command: ["java", "-jar", "webapp-runner.jar", "--port", "$(PORT)", "my-app.war"]
