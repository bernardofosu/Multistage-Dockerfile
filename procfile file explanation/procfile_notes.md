# 📜 Procfile – Meaning and Usage

A **Procfile** is a small but important file 📜 you’ll often bump into when dealing with deployment platforms like **Heroku**, **Dokku**, or **Cloud Foundry**.

---

## 🔎 What is a Procfile?
- It’s a **process file** that tells the platform **how to start your application**.  
- It lives in the **root of your project** (next to `pom.xml`, `requirements.txt`, `package.json`, etc.).  
- The file has **no extension** (`Procfile`, not `Procfile.txt`).  

---

## 🏗 Structure
It’s a simple text file with a process type and the command to run:

```
<process_type>: <command>
```

### Example 1: Python (Flask/Django)
```
web: gunicorn app:app
```
- `web` → tells the platform this is the main web process.  
- `gunicorn app:app` → command to start the app (Gunicorn serving Flask/Django).  

### Example 2: Node.js
```
web: node server.js
```

### Example 3: Java (Spring Boot with Maven/Gradle)
```
web: java -jar target/my-app.jar
```

---

## 🧩 Why is it important?
- Without a `Procfile`, platforms like Heroku **don’t know how to run your app**.  
- It defines one or more process types:  
  - `web` → main web server (required if serving HTTP).  
  - `worker` → background jobs.  
  - `scheduler` → cron-like scheduled tasks.

## 🚀 DevOps Context
For a DevOps engineer, the `Procfile` is like a **startup manifest**:  
- In **Docker**, this is equivalent to your `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` in a `Dockerfile`.  
- In **Kubernetes**, it’s like the `command`/`args` fields in a Pod spec.  
- In **Systemd/Linux**, it’s like the `ExecStart` in a service unit file.
